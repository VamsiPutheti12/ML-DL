A linear model is like a straight stickâ€”it can only separate data using a straight line or plane.
When we introduce non-linearity, we bend, twist, or warp that stick into more complex shapes like a Pringles chip, a curve, or even a multi-dimensional surface.
This allows the model to better fit the data and capture complex relationships.
Example: Why Non-Linearity Helps?
Imagine a moon-shaped dataset (like two crescent moons facing each other).
A linear classifier (without activation functions) would fail because it can only draw straight lines.
A neural network with activation functions can bend the decision boundary to fit the moons correctly!
